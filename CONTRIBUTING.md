### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+
- npm 9+

### Steps

```bash
# 1. Fork and clone
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/guildpass-integrations.git
cd guildpass-integrations

# 2. Install dependencies
npm install

# 3. Copy and configure environment

NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_MODE=true npm run dev

```

### Architecture overview

## Branching & Commits

- Branch off `main`: `git checkout -b feat/short-description` or `fix/short-description`
- Conventional commits:
  - `feat: add contribution history section to member dashboard`
  - `fix: correct role badge colour for contributor`
  - `style: align spacing on admin member list`
  - `test: add mock API test for membership status`
  - `chore: upgrade wagmi to v2.13`

---

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a PR against `Adamantine-Guild/guildpass-integrations` on `main`.
3. Fill in the [PR template](.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md) completely.
4. Ensure these pass:

```bash
npm run typecheck   # Must pass
npm run lint        # Fix all reported issues
```

### PR Quality Expectations

- UI changes must include a screenshot in the PR description.
- New components must work in mock mode (`NEXT_PUBLIC_MOCK_MODE=true`).
- Keep feature logic separate from presentational components.
- Add loading, empty, and error states in new feature modules.
- Prefer typed APIs and React Query for data fetching.
- No inline styles — use Tailwind classes.

---

## Review Process

- A maintainer will review your PR within **5 business days**.
- UI-heavy PRs may require a recording or live demo.
- Address all requested changes promptly.
